Simple Cache in Python

Implement a simple read-through cache for Users which looks up Users by ID and
returns their name by calling getUserByID() for users not in the cache. It is an error to
look up a user with a bad ID.
Demonstrate that the cache does not call the getUserByID() function a second time
when the same User ID is requested.
